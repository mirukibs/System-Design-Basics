# 🚀 System Design Basics 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to the System Design Basics! This guide is your compass in the vast sea of system design. Whether you're working on a project or navigating through software architecture, this repo will be your trusty first mate.

## Steps for System Design

### 1. 🤓 Understand Requirements:

- Dive deep into your project's requirements.
- Chat with stakeholders to iron out any wrinkles in understanding.

### 2. 🧩 Identify Components:

- Break down your system into bite-sized components.
- Identify the core functionalities each component will wield.

### 3. 🏗️ Choose Architecture:

- Architect your system. Pick an architecture pattern (monolithic, microservices, or others).
- Choose frameworks that work with you, your team and align with the non-funtional requirements (e.g., Java's Spring Boot or PHP's Laravel).

### 4. 🗄️ Data Design:

- Blueprint your database.
- Identify the tables, relationships, and data types.
- Consider database normalization for efficient data storage.

### 5. 📡 Define APIs:

- Define APIs for your services or components to communicate.
- Consider RESTful APIs for your web application.

### 6. 🔄 Flow Diagrams:

- Sketch the flow of data and control as they move through your system.
- This is where you use UML diagrams (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc).

### 7. 🔒 Security Considerations:

- Identify potential security threats.
- Design measures for authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

### 8. 🚀 Scalability:

- Consider scalability requirements.
- Design the system to handle growth in users, data, and transactions.

### 9. 🛠️ Error Handling:

- Plan how the system will handle errors gracefully.
- Implement logging mechanisms for debugging and monitoring.

### 10. 🎨 Prototyping:

- Consider creating a prototype or proof-of-concept.
- Validate critical aspects of your design before full-scale development.

### 11. 💻 Technology Stack:

- Confirm technologies and frameworks.
- Consider what you and your team is already competent with.
- Ensure alignment with the chosen architecture (e.g., Spring Boot, Laravel).

### 12. 🧪 Testing Strategy:

- Develop a comprehensive testing strategy like a mad scientist.
- Include unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, you can't go wrong with those.

### 13. 📚 Documentation:

- Document your system's odyssey in detail.
- Provide some resources for devs in your team now and later on.
